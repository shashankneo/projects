So after a long long, and another long while :p finally a movie came which keeps you totally glued to the screen, one and only our desi 'Dum laga ke haisha' :D Every frame with the background score knocks it well out of the park. Last time I had similar feelings about a desi movie was Udaan. Must see for anyone out there :)
