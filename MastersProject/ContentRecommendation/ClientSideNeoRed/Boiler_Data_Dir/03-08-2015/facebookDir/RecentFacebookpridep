Recent Facebook 'pride' profile photo change trend just reminded me of the fact that there are so many nasty vast generalizations lying everywhere around us..

People accusing each other in a condescending way of changing the profile pic without knowing the reason behind it. Calling out on their hypocrisy in real life is understandable. But something as minor as a profile pic on a virtual medium, and making a big meal of everything is stupid. If people do something without knowing the reason behind it, then there is jack shit we can do to change their  
 tendency to find a reason before doing anything.

Live and let people, and stop judging each other on every occasion.
