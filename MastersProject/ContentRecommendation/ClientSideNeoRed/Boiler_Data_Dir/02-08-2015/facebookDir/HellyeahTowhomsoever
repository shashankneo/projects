Hell yeah!! To whomsoever who said that I could write poetry if you can call some randomly assorted words as poetry. :D  Credits to a friend for being kind enough to lend me 4 of her lines to this poetry(in years) err rant :p

ps- Big prizes in store if any of you can guess which of the 4 lines were not mine :p Easy as cutting a butter with hot knife :p

The day divides the night; and night divides the day
Marks the return of the Gunslinger
Move aside all you racoon cum goons
A fiery reputation precedes the Man with no name
Mightiest of armies fallen apart with one gaze
Choking out a pride of lions with bare hands
Would the fables ever end?
Everybody just fell in line
There’s only one side to the mirror this time
Drum rolls, trumpet blow
Enters ‘the girl in Red dress’
Eyes don’t align
Footprints go sideways
But what the eff happened
The girl just entered
Love should have happened there & then
How can a sucker of a poet write so abruptly
That’s not what poets do
They have a magical flow to everything
Nonsense is okay
But something should make sense to interpret
Said ‘the pack’
What to do, What to do?
Truth be told,
There was no love to happen this time
Because ‘the girl in Red Dress’
Exited a long long time ago
After adding her own version to the fables
It’s not okay to burn
instead of fading away
She said;
Because you’ve still got your world around,
It’s still the same,
Nothing seems to have moved much.
Then what was it that just passed?
The Gunslinger did.
Another one bites the dust.
