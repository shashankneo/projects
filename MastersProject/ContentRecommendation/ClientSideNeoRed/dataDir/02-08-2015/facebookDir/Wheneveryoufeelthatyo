Whenever you feel that you're about to crash & burn in studies and whatnot , then it's time!! Time to take the moral high road, and  make a check-list of  what else we're missing out there. Time to take a look at the bigger picture. Time to stare deep into the abyss. :D

Well then while we're still building our house of cards, reality strikes 'one more time', and we're back to the same old swansong again. :p
