<p>Conservative billionaire Charles Koch told his ultra-rich friends that they face a &ldquo;life and death&rdquo; decision whether to keep lobbying for tax breaks and government subsidies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Business leaders (must) recognize that their behavior is suicide, that it is suicide long term. To survive, long-term, they have to start opposing, rather than promoting, corporate welfare,&rdquo; Koch told about 450 allies at an Orange County, Calif., summit that began Saturday.</p>
<p>With the Pacific Ocean behind him and friendly CEOs sipping wine nearby, one of the biggest political donors in the country said it is time for conservatives to start eschewing tax breaks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously, this prescription will not be an easy pill for many business people to swallow. Because short term, taking the principled path is going to cost some companies some profits, as it will for Koch Industries,&rdquo; the 79-year-old Koch said. &ldquo;But long term, it will allow business people to continue to own and run their businesses, which none of us will be able to do, in my view, in the future otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to big banks that took &ldquo;virtually free money from the Fed&rdquo; and bailouts in exchange for regulations. &ldquo;Now, the chickens are coming home to roost,&rdquo; Koch said. &ldquo;The Fed is taking control of these banks. The Fed now decides what businesses they can be in and how they run those businesses.&rdquo; Koch said &ldquo;regulators, auditors, controllers&rdquo; are implanted at the banks to keep tabs. The banks, Koch argued, end up making political donations to avoid too much oversight.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3981312"></div>
<p>Koch warned that other businesses would be next if their leaders continue taking government subsidies. &ldquo;This means stopping the subsidies, mandates and special privileges for business that enriches the haves at the expense of the have-nots,&rdquo; Koch said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that class distinction that Koch has made the focus of seminars at the luxurious resort. &ldquo;In my view, we&rsquo;re heading toward a two-tiered society, a society that is destroying opportunities for the disadvantaged and creating welfare for the rich,&rdquo; Koch said. &ldquo;Misguided policies are a creating a permanent underclass, crippling our economy and corrupting the business community&mdash;present company excepted, of course. But what this is doing, then, is turning more and more Americans against what they mistakenly believe is free enterprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his brother David, Koch is among the most powerful players in Republican politics by virtue of their wealth. Forbes estimates he and his brother is each worth $40 billion. They are tied for the No. 4 spot on Forbes&rsquo; rankings of the richest Americans.</p>
<p>Koch&rsquo;s opinions shape opinions among rank-and-file conservatives and congressional leaders alike. In fact, five White House hopefuls planned to cycle through the three-day summit in Dana Point, Calif. At least 14 members of Congress or Governors were on-hand, as well, and former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels was set to hold a private salon about campus speech later Saturday.</p>
<p>Koch&rsquo;s stinging words came as the allies who support the Koch-backed network of social and political groups mingled with like-minded leaders. The Koch-backed network plans to spend $889 million ahead of the 2016 elections, although officials are quick to point out that not all of that is explicitly political.</p>
<p>Some of it, advisers say, will be spent pushing against what Koch sees as unjustifiable corporate welfare.</p>

suicide long term. To survive, long-term, they have to start opposing, rather than promoting, corporate welfare,&rdquo; Koch told about 450 allies at an Orange County, Calif., summit that began Saturday.<\/p>\n<p>With the Pacific Ocean behind him and friendly CEOs sipping wine nearby, one of the biggest political donors in the country said it is time for conservatives to start eschewing tax breaks.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Obviously, this prescription will not be an easy pill for many business people to swallow. Because short term, taking the principled path is going to cost some companies some profits, as it will for Koch Industries,&rdquo; the 79-year-old Koch said. &ldquo;But long term, it will allow business people to continue to own and run their businesses, which none of us will be able to do, in my view, in the future otherwise.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>He pointed to big banks that took &ldquo;virtually free money from the Fed&rdquo; and bailouts in exchange for regulations. &ldquo;Now, the chickens are coming home to roost,&rdquo; Koch said. &ldquo;The Fed is taking control of these banks. The Fed now decides what businesses they can be in and how they run those businesses.&rdquo; Koch said &ldquo;regulators, auditors, controllers&rdquo; are implanted at the banks to keep tabs. The banks, Koch argued, end up making political donations to avoid too much oversight.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3981312\"><\/div>\n<p>Koch warned that other businesses would be next if their leaders continue taking government subsidies. &ldquo;This means stopping the subsidies, mandates and special privileges for business that enriches the haves at the expense of the have-nots,&rdquo; Koch said.<\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s that class distinction that Koch has made the focus of seminars at the luxurious resort. &ldquo;In my view, we&rsquo;re heading toward a two-tiered society, a society that is destroying opportunities for the disadvantaged and creating welfare for the rich,&rdquo; Koch said. &ldquo;Misguided policies are a creating a permanent underclass, crippling our economy and corrupting the business community&mdash;present company excepted, of course.

The Republican presidential candidate says the fact that she has an uphill climb is part of the rationale for her campaign.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, people are going to call you names. That&rsquo;s the price of leadership,&rdquo; Fiorina told 450 deep-pocketed conservative donors to the political machine backed by industrialists Charles and David Koch. &ldquo;Sometimes, women are sometimes called different names than men.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Asked which was more sexist&mdash;presidential politics or Silicon Valley&mdash;the former Hewlett-Packard CEO dodged. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a no-win question,&rdquo; she chuckled.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been called a bimbo at work. I&rsquo;ve been called the other name that starts with a B,&rdquo; she said, noting that she is often asked about the ways a female President might approach the White House differently than her predecessors. &ldquo;Can you think of a single instance in which a man&rsquo;s judgment might have been clouded by his hormones? Any at all? Ever in the Oval Office?&rdquo; Fiorina said to applause.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3981315\"><\/div>\n<p>Fiorina said she also sees a double standard in how the ultra-rich are described by journalists. Speaking before those very people, she chided Politico&rsquo;s Mike Allen for asking if there was too much money in the political space.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember seeing big newspaper articles about George Soros or Tom Steyer. The media doesn&rsquo;t like one of money but it&rsquo;s OK with another kind of money,&rdquo; she said to applause. &ldquo;Everyone has a right to speech in this country.

Another night has passed, and the 29-year-old Eritrean has still not managed to reach England. As the sun rises, he begins his 3-hour walk back to the dusty scrubland on the outskirts of Calais, to the makeshift camps known as &#8220;the Jungle&#8221; to its 3,000 residents. Edris has already ended up staying much longer than he imagined, but he refuses to call it home.<\/p>\n<p>A brother, a son, a student, a citizen&mdash;Edris had once been many things to many people. But like everyone else in the Jungle, he now holds only the deracinated, dispossessed status of the migrant. &ldquo;It is not a good life here, it is not good at all,&rdquo; he says, picking at a yellowing wound on his shin, the souvenir of an attempt to scale the barbed wire fencing that surrounds the port. Edris left his family behind in the Eritrean capital of Asmara nearly a year ago, fleeing the country&rsquo;s compulsory life-long military service. Eritrea&#8217;s repressive government scores lower on political and press freedom rankings than even North Korea. Edris has crossed the sweltering expanse of the Sahara, made a perilous sea journey across the Mediterranean from Libya to Italy, and arrived in the French port city of Calais in the freezing depths of winter. But more than six months on, his quest is not over.<\/p>\n<p>Edris shares the determination of countless migrants in Calais, who are desperate to escape the squalid conditions of the Jungle. Fueled by the belief that a better life awaits them on the other side of the Channel, they see their situation as temporary. They are drawn to England because they speak the language, have relatives and friends who have settled there or believe the job market will be better than in France.<\/p>\n<p>Others feel differently. Many end up applying for asylum in France, giving themselves a time frame by which they will give up trying to reach England. Some continue to live in the Jungle while they endure the long wait for papers to be processed.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/08\/calais-migrants-camp-4.jpg?w=560&#038;quality=65&#038;strip=color&#038;h=373\" alt=\"Calais Migrants camp\" height=\"373\">\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\" ><span class=\"credit\" >Rob Stothard&mdash;Getty Images<\/span><span class=\"caption\" >Sudanese men build a wooden structure at a make shift camp near the port of Calais in Calais, France, on July 31, 2015.<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>As a result, the Jungle is becoming a more permanent fixture in the Calais landscape. It sprung up without approval, but it has evolved into a shanty town of sorts&mdash;albeit one that falls far below international humanitarian standards. Though France is the world&rsquo;s sixth biggest economy, the Jungle on the northern edge of Calais would not pass for a refugee camp in a developing nation. Guidelines from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees recommend a maximum of 20 people using one toilet, but in the Jungle, 300 migrants share a single toilet. Piles of garbage attract rats and flies, and the air is thick with the stench of sewage and rotting food.<\/p>\n<p>However, locals who volunteer in the Jungle say conditions are slowly improving. In January the French government opened the Jules Ferry refugee center, built on a former children&rsquo;s summer camp, with space for 120 women and children to sleep. In response to criticism from the U.N. and aid groups, the French government has begun a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/europe\/calais-migrant-shanty-town-to-be-provided-with-water-and-electricity-by-french-government-10335225.htmlhttp:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/europe\/calais-migrant-shanty-town-to-be-provided-with-water-and-electricity-by-french-government-10335225.html\">$550,000 project<\/a> to improve the basic infrastructure in the camp. In the last month, streetlights have gone up and faucets providing cold water have been installed. Volunteers say that the camp is bigger than ever before, but also better organized.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The government is more present on the ground here in Calais, and works more with the charities now,&rdquo; said Carolyn Wiggins, 54, a longtime volunteer with the city&rsquo;s migrant associations over the 11 years she has lived in Calais. In the last 18 months, she and her husband, Michel, have joined about 20 volunteers as part of the French aid organization SALAM. Five days a week, the couple help to serve 2,000 evening meals at the Jules Ferry center, where they have noticed a significant uptick in the number of people requiring food. They also collect supplies from the local foodbank, including vegetables, fruit and bread, and distribute them at the encampments twice a week.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3981246\"><\/div>\n<p>The medical charity <em>M&eacute;decins du Monde<\/em> has also opened a makeshift hospital in wooden sheds where staff volunteers offer upwards of 40 consultations a day. Its director of operations, Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Corty, told TIME that as well as infections caused by the filthy state of the camp, the staff are seeing more and more broken bones as migrants make even riskier attempts to stow away on Britain-bound vehicles.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/08\/calais-migrants-camp-5.jpg?w=560&#038;quality=65&#038;strip=color&#038;h=373\" alt=\"Calais Migrants camp\" height=\"373\">\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\" ><span class=\"credit\" >Rob Stothard&mdash;Getty Images<\/span><span class=\"caption\" >A tent at a make shift camp near the port of Calais in Calais, France, on July 31, 2015.<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Of course, not all the wounds are visible. In every tent is a story of personal horror, and the psychological effects of the journeys endured by the refugees are all too evident. Mustafa, 27, was training to be a doctor in Khartoum, Sudan before he fled his country&rsquo;s political turmoil. He is still traumatized by the image of a 15-year-old Syrian girl who died of diabetic shock during their difficult eight-day voyage across the sea from Egypt to Italy. &ldquo;The boat owner told her father that it was a 5-star boat with a doctor, and so he paid $50,000 for the family to cross,&rdquo; he said softly, adding that the smuggler made the family throw the girl&rsquo;s body off the boat when she died. &ldquo;I still see her, I see her in front of my eyes.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The women of the Jungle are haunted too, by their vulnerability in a camp where 90% of residents are men. Corty of <em>M&eacute;decins du Monde<\/em> said there has been a sharp increase in women and children in the camp since last summer, but the Jules Ferry center has been full for a long time. Those not lucky enough to get a bed there must sleep in the Jungle. &ldquo;I am always scared, always scared to sleep,&rdquo; said a 22-year-old Eritrean woman who gave her name only as Fiyori.<\/p>\n<p>Yet for the most part, people in the Jungle prefer to exchange jokes rather than stories of woe. Many of the migrants wearily accept that they will be in Calais longer than they would like: <em>Bored of borders, <\/em>reads a sign outside one tent. In the Jungle, you can now get your hair cut, get your bike fixed and even pray in an improvised mosque or church. Some of the more enterprising residents walk to the supermarkets in the center of Calais, stocking up on baguettes, potato chips and canned goods to hawk for a profit back in the Jungle. There are over a dozen pop-up shops, selling everything from cell phone SIM cards and cigarettes to whiskey, Red Bull and Coca-Cola.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/08\/calais-migrants-camp-3.jpg?w=560&#038;quality=65&#038;strip=color&#038;h=373\" alt=\"Calais Migrants camp\" height=\"373\">\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\" ><span class=\"credit\" >Rob Stothard&mdash;Getty Images<\/span><span class=\"caption\" >Men buy from a shop run by Afghanis at a make shift camp near the port of Calais in Calais, France, on July 31, 2015.<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>There are reports of occasional alcohol-fueled scuffles when frustrations spill over but most people in the camp aren&#8217;t looking for more trouble. A Nigerian refugee recently set up a makeshift school where volunteers teach French and drawing and play games with the children. At night, people dance to Michael Jackson songs under a disco ball in a makeshift club.<\/p>\n<p>In the Jungle, life goes on even as most of the residents vow to continue their attempts to reach England. Mahmoud, a 22-year-old Sudanese whose entire family was killed by Janjaweed militia, said he will keep trying to cross until he makes it&mdash;or dies trying. Friends and family have arrived in England successfully, escaping the squalor that he has endured for 15 months. He refuses to build a more permanent shelter, sleeping under a black plastic tarpaulin propped up by wooden sticks. Scrawled across the outside in white letters are the words: <em>Ceci n&rsquo;est pas une solution d&rsquo;h&eacute;bergement. <\/em>This is not a housing solution.<\/p>\n<p><a

Gox went offline early last year. Karpeles said then that tens of thousands of bitcoins worth several hundred million dollars were unaccounted for, and suggested they were stolen by hacking.<\/p>\n<p>The relationship between the lost bitcoins and the inflated account was not immediately clear.<\/p>\n<p>Japanese TV showed a T-shirt-clad Karpeles, with a baseball cap pulled low over his face, being led into a police car from his home in Tokyo.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper brightcove-size-large\" data-pos=\"6\" data-continuous=\"1\" data-playlist=\"0\"><object id=\"bc-video-2804786912001-6\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/1IBTuH5\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"2804786912001\"><\/object><\/div>\n<p>Japanese authorities have acknowledged they were baffled by the Mt.

They also left with an average student debt of $35,000 for a bachelor&rsquo;s degree&mdash;earning the distinction of being the <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.wsj.com\/economics\/2015\/05\/08\/congratulations-class-of-2015-youre-the-most-indebted-ever-for-now\/\"><span style=\"color:#1155cc;\">most indebted graduating class in history<\/span><\/a>. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s a title they will probably concede to the class of 2016 next spring.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">With numbers like these, it is becoming clear that innovative approaches are desperately needed. With their new book, The Real College Debt Crisis: How Student Borrowing Threatens Financial Well-Being and Erodes the American Dream, University of Kansas professors William Elliott III and Melinda Lewis offer one such paradigm shift. They argue that we&rsquo;re missing the bigger picture when it comes to student debt. The skyrocketing rates of student indebtedness are, in their estimation, a symptom of an even more serious problem: that the reluctant acceptance of debt as a de facto method for paying for college <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/wonkblog\/wp\/2015\/07\/29\/millennials-should-no-longer-dream-of-ever-becoming-millionaires\/\"><span style=\"color:#1155cc;\">reinforces social and financial inequality<\/span><\/a> by saddling borrowers with excessive financial burdens at the beginning of their careers and hurting their chances to achieve economic mobility post-graduation.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">&ldquo;If we begin to think of education as a part of the economic mobility system, then we can begin to think of education&rsquo;s implications for children long after school,&rdquo; Elliott, who also serves as the founding director of the Center on Assets, Education, and Inclusion (AEDI), explained at a recent New America event. Along with his co-author, Elliott was joined by Demos Senior Policy Analyst Mark Huelsman and New America Education Policy Program Director Kevin Carey for a discussion on the importance of developing new college financing models that could reduce inequity between students of varying income levels.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">&ldquo;We fundamentally believe that education is really important, but because of the weight of [student] debt, experts are starting to question whether or not the return on investment is really there,&rdquo; Elliott said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">The panelists&rsquo; conversation comes at a moment of heightened attention on the burdens student debt often places on young borrowers and their families. Last year, <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.wsj.com\/washwire\/2014\/11\/13\/how-democrats-owe-their-midterm-losses-to-student-loans\/\"><span style=\"color:#1155cc;\">exit polling of Millennial voters<\/span><\/a> intimated that student debt was a point of concern during the midterm elections, prompting politicians to jump on an<span style=\"color:#1155cc;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/where-the-presidential-candidates-stand-on-student-debt-2015-07-28?siteid=rss&amp;rss=1\"> increasingly crowded &ldquo;student debt is a serious issue&#8221; bandwagon<\/a> <\/span>during the preliminary rounds of the 2016 presidential campaign. And in March, President Obama announced the creation of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/blog\/2015\/03\/10\/student-aid-bill-rights-enhancing-protections-student-loan-borrowers\"><span style=\"color:#1155cc;\">Student Aid Bill of Rights<\/span><\/a> that seeks to change how federal agencies interact with students that take out federal loans to finance the cost of higher education.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">Unfortunately, according to the panelists, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/business\/economy\/how-student-debt-became-a-presidential-campaign-issue\/2015\/05\/24\/1463948e-f41c-11e4-b2f3-af5479e6bbdd_story.html\"><span style=\"color:#1155cc;\">political discussions of the student debt crisis<\/span><\/a> often fail to acknowledge how student debt can have <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2013\/05\/how-colleges-are-selling-out-the-poor-to-court-the-rich\/275725\/\"><span style=\"color:#1155cc;\">disparate and lifelong<\/span><\/a> effects on the asset building capacity of young borrowers from different racial and economic backgrounds. It is often the students who stand to benefit the most from attending college who struggle with debt after graduation or drop out before receiving a degree, creating what Huelsman referred to as a &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.demos.org\/publication\/debt-divide-racial-and-class-bias-behind-new-normal-student-borrowing\"><span style=\"color:#1155cc;\">Debt Divide<\/span><\/a>&rdquo;&mdash;a phenomenon wherein those with the highest need for student loans are the most susceptible to negative outcomes before and after graduation.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">&ldquo;There is a fundamental difference in student debt that&rsquo;s taken on by someone from a low-income background and debt that&rsquo;s taken on by someone from a middle or upper class background,&rdquo; Huelsman said. &ldquo;There are people for whom every dollar matters so much more, and they don&rsquo;t have the extended family resources that can leverage assets to take on debt.&rdquo;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3980583\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"normal\">When speaking about the increase in the number of students taking out loans, Huelsman pointed out that the higher education system was never meant to trade debt for diplomas, but because of a series of policy changes that reduced institutional funding and increased costs, &ldquo;we now have an almost entirely debt-funded higher education system.&rdquo; And while media outlets and pundits are quick to highlight how <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-04-30\/how-student-loans-could-cripple-the-u-s-economy\"><span style=\"color:#1155cc;\">this debt-funded system is wreaking havoc on the economy<\/span><\/a>, Huelsman also noted that looking at the problem as being one of borrowers breaching <span style=\"color:#1155cc;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.credit.com\/2013\/05\/student-loan-debt-how-much-is-too-much-66165\/?utm_source=MoneyMagazine&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=IB_3&amp;utm_campaign=inequality_stats\">some invisible threshold of acceptable debt<\/a> <\/span>obscures a far more pressing question: why is debt even necessary to afford higher education in the first place?<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">Huelsman&rsquo;s comments resonated with a key argument Elliott and Lewis make in The Real College Debt Crisis&mdash;that despite the seemingly good intentions of policy wonks and reporters there is a disconnect between the aspects of the student debt &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; that are being addressed publicly and the challenges that are actually impacting the ability of borrowers to build assets and attain mobility. &ldquo;One of the problems that we get into when we aren&rsquo;t correctly diagnosing or defining the problems created by student debt is that the solutions we propose are not aimed at the right target,&rdquo; Lewis explained.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">In their book, Elliott and Lewis advocate moving college financing away from a &ldquo;debt-dependency&rdquo; model (and the short-term solutions that it encourages) and towards an asset-building model that enables anyone willing to put in the effort to grow their wealth over time. One concrete mechanism they recommend is the increased use of Children&rsquo;s Savings Accounts (CSAs), as a tool for leveraging assets accumulated from birth as a form of financial aid. &ldquo;There is everything right with a centralized, portable financial product that will get more people to and through college,&rdquo; Huelsman noted when speaking of the CSA concept. &ldquo;But it has to mean something in the terms of college cost.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">Carey agreed college cost is unlikely to decrease with the institutions themselves in the driver&rsquo;s seat, serving&mdash;as he put it&mdash;as both the benefactor and the perpetuator of the student debt crisis. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty good to be in a business where your customers say to themselves &lsquo;Well if I gotta borrow, I gotta borrow,&rsquo;&rdquo; Carey said. &ldquo;Not many businesses have that luxury, but colleges and universities do.&rdquo; Carey also lamented the Obama administration&rsquo;s recent announcement that it <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/grade-point\/wp\/2015\/06\/25\/obama-administration-retreats-from-federal-college-rating-plan\/\"><span style=\"color:#1155cc;\">would abandon its plan to implement a college rating system<\/span><\/a>, which he felt had potential to help colleges take an active role in preventing their graduates from defaulting on their student loans.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">Elliott acknowledged value in Carey&rsquo;s accountability-centric approach, but suggested that without an overhaul in how college educations are financed, the larger problem of student debt would remain.<\/p>\n<p class=\"normal\">&ldquo;We are afraid to re-envision and re-think how financial aid can be done,&rdquo; Elliott said. &ldquo;We need a long-term solution that not only changes education, but [also addresses] the great wealth inequality that we see in our society.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><em>This piece was originally published in New America&rsquo;s digital magazine, <\/em><em><a href=\"http:\/\/weeklywonk.newamerica.org\/\">The Weekly Wonk<\/a>. <\/em><em>Sign up to get it delivered to your inbox each Thursday <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/weeklywonk.newamerica.net\/subscribe-email\/\"><em>here<\/em><\/a><em>, and <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NewAmerica\"><em>follow @New America<\/em><\/a><em> on Twitter<br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div class=\"video-wrapper brightcove-size-large\" data-pos=\"8\" data-continuous=\"1\" data-playlist=\"0\"><object id=\"bc-video-4260687254001-8\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/1DfLue5\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4260687254001\"><\/object><\/div><\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Ideas","slug":"ideas","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/ideas\/","description":"TIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary and expertise on the most compelling events in news, society, and culture.

The Rio Local Organizing Committee and the IOC are requested to follow WHO recommendations on treatment of household and hospital waste.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A spokesman from the Rio organizing committee referred comment to the IOC, which is meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.<\/p>\n<p>Olympic organizers and the Brazilian government have tested only for bacteria to decide if the water is safe. Many experts say viruses are a far bigger problem and need to be monitored.<\/p>\n<p>The International Sailing Federation said independently it would start testing for viruses.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to find someone who can do the testing for us that can safely cover what we need to know from a virus perspective as well as the bacteria perspective,&#8221; Peter Sowrey, chief executive of the ISF, said. &#8220;That&#8217;s my plan.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper brightcove-size-large\" data-pos=\"10\" data-continuous=\"1\" data-playlist=\"0\"><object id=\"bc-video-4389502505001-10\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/1IQoHbt\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4389502505001\"><\/object><\/div>\n<p>The sailing venue in Guanabara Bay is badly polluted, as is a separate venue for rowing and canoeing &mdash; Rodrigo de Freitas lake &mdash; in central Rio. The AP investigation also showed venues for triathlon and open-water swimming off Copacabana Beach had high virus levels that pose a threat to athletes and tourists.<\/p>\n<p>Sowrey, who spoke from Kuala Lumpur, has a local interest. His wife Alesandra is a native of Rio, and he has a 9-year-old daughter Marie.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a father myself,&#8221; Sowrey said. &#8220;I want to make sure that everyone who goes out in the water is as safe as possible and is given the right guidance and right security.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The AP analysis showed dangerously high levels of viruses and bacteria from sewage in venues where about 1,400 athletes will compete in water sports, in the games which open in a year &mdash; Aug. 5, 2016.<\/p>\n<p>In Rio, much of the waste and sewage goes untreated and runs down hillside ditches and streams into Olympic water venues that are littered with floating rubbish, household waste, and even dead animals.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3981194\"><\/div>\n<p>At the world swimming championships in Kazan, Russia, swimmers said they were worried about the situation in Rio.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The athletes and the athletes&#8217; commission have expressed their concern at the current problems with the quality of water, the cleanliness of the water,&#8221; Vladimir Salnikov, a former Olympic gold-medal winner, said. &#8220;That will be put into a recommendation, and people will pay attention to that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Shin Otsuka, an executive board member of the International Triathlon Union, said on Friday his body was considering testing for viruses.<\/p>\n<p>The ITU is holding an Olympic qualifying race on Sunday using the waters off Copacabana Beach.<\/p>\n<p>Costa Rican triathlete Leonardo Chacon said he knows the risks, but will take them.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We know we are exposed to viruses, maybe to a health problem later,&#8221; he said on Friday in Rio. &#8220;But in my case, I have invested so much to prepare myself for this, and I want this to happen because I can&#8217;t recuperate this investment any other way other than competing and winning the points that I need to win.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When Rio was awarded the Olympics in 2009, it promised cleaning its waters would be an Olympic legacy. But Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes has repeatedly acknowledged this will not be done, calling it a &#8220;lost opportunity.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Sowrey said the ISAF would start doing its own water testing in Rio this month, no longer relying solely on Brazil&#8217;s government analysis.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to make sure we keep pressure on the organizing committee and the Brazilians to make sure they put some energy into cleaning up the bay,&#8221; Sowrey said. &#8220;My job is to make sure something actually happens and it&#8217;s not just talk, and someone is actually walking the walk.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Sowery said he received a call from a woman who wanted reassurance that the ISAF was giving the right guidance to her child and others competing in an Olympic sailing test event this month in Rio.<\/p>\n<p>He said a &#8220;backup plan&#8221; included sailing all the events outside Guanabara Bay in the open Atlantic. The ISAF has three courses there, and three inside the bay.<\/p>\n<p>He said it would be &#8220;&#8216;heartbreaking&#8221; to sail outside the bay and lose the postcard backdrop of Sugarloaf Mountain, which will be a focus of television coverage.<\/p>\n<p>In most Olympics, sailing is contested far from the main Olympic venues. In Rio, the sailors and rowers and canoeists get center stage &mdash; a chance to win fans and valuable sponsors.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to sacrifice health for the sake of good pictures and good TV,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But the backdrop of Rio is an amazing backdrop, and will do something for the sport of sailing.&#8221;<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more","world":true},"tag":{"name":"brazil","slug":"brazil","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/brazil\/"},"tags":"brazil","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/08\/rio-beach-water.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/08\/rio-beach-water.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=280","small_2x":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/08\/rio-beach-water.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=560","large":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/08\/rio-beach-water.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=550","large_2x":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/08\/rio-beach-water.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=1100"},"credit":"Ricardo Moraes\u2014Reuters","caption":"A fisherman casts his line as birds fly over the Sao Conrado beach in Rio de Janeiro on Feb. 26, 2015.
