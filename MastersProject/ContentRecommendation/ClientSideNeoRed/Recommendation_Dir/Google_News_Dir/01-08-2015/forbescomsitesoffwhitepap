It is easy to cast aspersions and ridicule almost everything about Donald&rsquo;s shoot-from-the-hip campaign from his inflammatory and offensive epithets about Mexicans, his over-simplified Wollman Rink strategy for the Middle East, his cringe-worthy McCain bashing, his arrogant diatribes against the Chinese (his best customers), his self-aggrandizing insults of all politicians and his mocking distain of traditional media.\r\n\r\nWhat&rsquo;s not so easy and a bit unnerving is to reframe Donald&rsquo;s campaign using the central question of disruptive innovation theory: what job is Donald Trump <em>really</em>&nbsp;trying to get done? Maybe Donald, being as smart as he is, knows full well the job is not to become President but rather to create a crisis for the political <em>status quo</em>. While the benefits to Donald of running are self-evident&mdash;enormous, invaluable promotion of the Trump brand along with basking in the limelight of hyper-celebritydom&mdash;what if the real job is simply to highlight the absurdity of the existing system?\r\n</p><div style=\"margin-left: 50px\">\r\n<blockquote><em><strong>What&rsquo;s not so easy and a bit unnerving is to reframe Donald&rsquo;s campaign using the central question of disruptive innovation theory: what job is&nbsp;Donald Trump&nbsp;really&nbsp;trying to get done?</strong></em></blockquote>\r\n</div>\r\n[youtubevid id=\"f0UB06v7yLY\"]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs bizarre as it might be, could he actually be the only catalytic agent capable of initiating a paradigm shift in politics? Students of Thomas Kuhn&rsquo;s <em>Theory of Scientific Revolutions</em> know that it takes sufficient anomalies, outliers and black swans that can't be explained to create a crisis in the existing model that results in a collective recognition by the stakeholders that indeed the prevailing model has broken down. Donald just may be the political anomaly, outlier and black swan all wrapped up in one that can finally illuminate for Americans the highly dysfunctional, polarized political system that is simply collapsing, like a black hole, under its own weight.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_fa801a5018724cb98754be119f89e524\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"dam-image ap size-large wp-image-fa801a5018724cb98754be119f89e524\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/fa801a5018724cb98754be119f89e524/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\"> Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a rally and picnic, Saturday, July 25, 2015, in Oskaloosa, Iowa. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHaving reduced politics over the past decades to sound bites, trigger-finger polls, ideological litmus tests, handlers, endless fundraising, cronyism and politics-as-entertainment are we simply getting what we deserve?&nbsp;Donald Trump&nbsp;is the logical conclusion to the breakdown of the American political system. Love him or hate him he&rsquo;s got everyone talking. &nbsp;This is particularly remarkable given a platform that has no real substance, no agenda, no strategy and no plan other than the simplistic slogan: make America great again.\r\n\r\nAnd we will all be watching the first Republican debates with baited breath. As Donald makes hay, he might also be the last straw that breaks the camel&rsquo;s back.\r\n\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n\r\nOf course Donald is a carnival barker. But the carnival he is unmasking is the Presidential race and the clowns he is revealing are the candidates. Donald&rsquo;s antics of reducing politics to the theater of the absurd challenge Americans to create a new paradigm&mdash;one where we can redefine what our politicians need to be. But are we ready and can we really handle the truth?\r\n<ul><li>Do we American&rsquo;s really want politicians who tell us hard truths about what it will take to solve our intractable problems?</li>\r\n\t<li>Do we really want politicians who, because they are authentic, will sometimes say the politically incorrect thing despite fear of reprisal in a our gotcha culture.</li>\r\n\t<li>Do we want politicians who earn our trust and are not owned by special interests or the 1%?</li>\r\n\t<li>Do we want politicians who take governing seriously rather than simply always running for office?</li>\r\n\t<li>Do we want politicians who are polarizing ideologues or realists who can get things done?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe are \"platform agnostic\" as to whether Donald is the best thing or the worst thing that has ever happened to American politics. But it certainly looks like the Trump candidacy qualifies as a disruptive political innovation. The classic definition of a disruptive innovation (admittedly oversimplified)&nbsp;is:<em>&nbsp;a simpler, cheaper, more accessible product or service that is good enough to get the job done that enters at the low end of the market.&nbsp;</em>\r\n\r\nIf Trump&rsquo;s real job is not to become President, but to bring about fundamental change to the political marketplace by scaring the bejesus out of the political incumbents and the majority of Americans as well, he has certainly taken an innovative approach and is doing quite well. Americans will ultimately have to decide if he is good enough to get the job done.","text":null,"description":"VideoBy Craig Hatkoff  and Irwin Kula Despite all of the hoopla about Donald Trump’s quixotic quest to become the 45th President of the United States, it remains highly improbable, in spite of leading in the Republican polls, that the Donald will ever sit in the Oval Office.

45<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;President of the United States, it remains highly improbable, in spite of <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/donald-trump-surge-jeb-bush-slump-2016-poll-120795.html\" target=\"_blank\">leading in the Republican polls</a>, that the Donald will ever sit in the Oval Office. It is easy to cast aspersions and ridicule almost everything about Donald’s shoot-from-the-hip campaign from his inflammatory and offensive epithets about Mexicans, his over-simplified Wollman Rink strategy for the Middle East, his cringe-worthy McCain bashing, his arrogant diatribes against the Chinese (his best customers), his self-aggrandizing insults of all politicians and his mocking distain of traditional media.</p>\n<p>What’s not so easy and a bit unnerving is to reframe Donald’s campaign using the central question of disruptive innovation theory: what job is Donald Trump <em>really</em>&nbsp;trying to get done? Maybe Donald, being as smart as he is, knows full well the job is not to become President but rather to create a crisis for the political <em>status quo</em>. While the benefits to Donald of running are self-evident—enormous, invaluable promotion of the Trump brand along with basking in the limelight of hyper-celebritydom—what if the real job is simply to highlight the absurdity of the existing system?</p>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 50px\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p><em><strong>What’s not so easy and a bit unnerving is to reframe Donald’s campaign using the central question of disruptive innovation theory: what job is&nbsp;Donald Trump&nbsp;really&nbsp;trying to get done?</strong></em></p> \n </blockquote> \n</div>\n<div id=\"brandvoice_inline\" dynamic-ad-unit=\"ntv-article\" data-dynamic=\"true\" class=\"article-native-ad\"></div>\n<div class=\"youtube-wrapper\"> \n <iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"485\" height=\"365\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/f0UB06v7yLY\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</div>\n<p>As bizarre as it might be, could he actually be the only catalytic agent capable of initiating a paradigm shift in politics?

Love him or hate him he’s got everyone talking. &nbsp;This is particularly remarkable given a platform that has no real substance, no agenda, no strategy and no plan other than the simplistic slogan: make America great again.</p>\n<p>And we will all be watching the first Republican debates with baited breath. As Donald makes hay, he might also be the last straw that breaks the camel’s back.</p>","<p>Of course Donald is a carnival barker. But the carnival he is unmasking is the Presidential race and the clowns he is revealing are the candidates. Donald’s antics of reducing politics to the theater of the absurd challenge Americans to create a new paradigm—one where we can redefine what our politicians need to be. But are we ready and can we really handle the truth?</p>\n<ul> \n <li>Do we American’s really want politicians who tell us hard truths about what it will take to solve our intractable problems?</li> \n <li>Do we really want politicians who, because they are authentic, will sometimes say the politically incorrect thing despite fear of reprisal in a our gotcha culture.</li> \n <li>Do we want politicians who earn our trust and are not owned by special interests or the 1%?</li> \n <li>Do we want politicians who take governing seriously rather than simply always running for office?</li> \n <div id=\"brandvoice_inline\" dynamic-ad-unit=\"ntv-article\" data-dynamic=\"true\" class=\"article-native-ad\"></div> \n <li>Do we want politicians who are polarizing ideologues or realists who can get things done?</li> \n</ul>\n<p>We are “platform agnostic” as to whether Donald is the best thing or the worst thing that has ever happened to American politics. But it certainly looks like the Trump candidacy qualifies as a disruptive political innovation. The classic definition of a disruptive innovation (admittedly oversimplified)&nbsp;is:<em>&nbsp;a simpler, cheaper, more accessible product or service that is good enough to get the job done that enters at the low end of the market.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>If Trump’s real job is not to become President, but to bring about fundamental change to the political marketplace by scaring the bejesus out of the political incumbents and the majority of Americans as well, he has certainly taken an innovative approach and is doing quite well. Americans will ultimately have to decide if he is good enough to get the job done.</p>"],"brandsToFilter":null,"galleryId":null,"removePaywall":null,"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_6","channelId":null,"channelName":"Leadership","sectionId":null,"sectionName":null,"url":"/leadership","title":null,"description":null,"keywords":null,"omnitureChannel":null,"omnitureSection":null,"twitterHashtag":null,"streamLimit":null,"subHead":null,"showNavBar":null,"tabsToHide":null,"showMore":null,"shortName":null,"hideRelatedVideos":null,"hideVideo":null,"stopPlayList":null,"pinnedLimit":null,"specialSlot":null,"swimLane":null,"shortUri":null,"mostPopularTabs":null,"videoShowName":null,"embargo":null,"specialReportTemplate":null,"customTitle":null,"customTopRightRail":null,"customFeature":null,"customTopStream":null,"customBottomStream":null,"customTopFeature":null,"customSponsorship":null,"showSponsorBy":null,"numberOfPromos":null,"pageType":null,"image":null,"editorialSlot":null,"jsFile":null,"cssFile":null,"author":null,"brandVoice":null},{"id":"channel_6section_116","channelId":null,"channelName":"Leadership","sectionId":null,"sectionName":"Risk","url":"/risk","title":null,"description":null,"keywords":null,"omnitureChannel":null,"omnitureSection":null,"twitterHashtag":null,"streamLimit":null,"subHead":null,"showNavBar":null,"tabsToHide":null,"showMore":null,"shortName":null,"hideRelatedVideos":null,"hideVideo":null,"stopPlayList":null,"pinnedLimit":null,"specialSlot":null,"swimLane":null,"shortUri":null,"mostPopularTabs":null,"videoShowName":null,"embargo":null,"specialReportTemplate":null,"customTitle":null,"customTopRightRail":null,"customFeature":null,"customTopStream":null,"customBottomStream":null,"customTopFeature":null,"customSponsorship":null,"showSponsorBy":null,"numberOfPromos":null,"pageType":null,"image":null,"editorialSlot":null,"jsFile":null,"cssFile":null,"author":null,"brandVoice":null},{"id":"channel_6section_153","channelId":null,"channelName":"Leadership","sectionId":null,"sectionName":"Power Redefined","url":"/power-redefined","title":null,"description":null,"keywords":null,"omnitureChannel":null,"omnitureSection":null,"twitterHashtag":null,"streamLimit":null,"subHead":null,"showNavBar":null,"tabsToHide":null,"showMore":null,"shortName":null,"hideRelatedVideos":null,"hideVideo":null,"stopPlayList":null,"pinnedLimit":null,"specialSlot":null,"swimLane":null,"shortUri":null,"mostPopularTabs":null,"videoShowName":null,"embargo":null,"specialReportTemplate":null,"customTitle":null,"customTopRightRail":null,"customFeature":null,"customTopStream":null,"customBottomStream":null,"customTopFeature":null,"customSponsorship":null,"showSponsorBy":null,"numberOfPromos":null,"pageType":null,"image":null,"editorialSlot":null,"jsFile":null,"cssFile":null,"author":null,"brandVoice":null},{"id":"channel_6section_44","channelId":null,"channelName":"Leadership","sectionId":null,"sectionName":"Leaders","url":"/leaders","title":null,"description":null,"keywords":null,"omnitureChannel":null,"omnitureSection":null,"twitterHashtag":null,"streamLimit":null,"subHead":null,"showNavBar":null,"tabsToHide":null,"showMore":null,"shortName":null,"hideRelatedVideos":null,"hideVideo":null,"stopPlayList":null,"pinnedLimit":null,"specialSlot":null,"swimLane":null,"shortUri":null,"mostPopularTabs":null,"videoShowName":null,"embargo":null,"specialReportTemplate":null,"customTitle":null,"customTopRightRail":null,"customFeature":null,"customTopStream":null,"customBottomStream":null,"customTopFeature":null,"customSponsorship":null,"showSponsorBy":null,"numberOfPromos":null,"pageType":null,"image":null,"editorialSlot":null,"jsFile":null,"cssFile":null,"author":null,"brandVoice":null}],"individualAuthor":{"id":null,"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/584690","name":"Off White Papers","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/07/Off-White-Papers_avatar_1438362540-40x40.jpg"},{"size":62,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/07/Off-White-Papers_avatar_1438362540-62x62.jpg"},{"size":136,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/07/Off-White-Papers_avatar_1438362540-136x136.jpg"},{"size":400,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/07/Off-White-Papers_avatar_1438362540.jpg"}],"contents":null,"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/offwhitepapers/","channelSectionMappings":null,"type":"Contributor","profileUrl":"/sites/offwhitepapers/","twitterName":"offwhites","authorType":"individual","facebookName":null,"linkedIn":null,"email":"chatkoff1@gmail.com","tagName":null,"blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"bio":null,"shortBio":null,"amazon":null,"webSite":"http://offwhitepapers.com/","advoiceBrand":null,"timestamp":1438486841474,"description":"We created the Off-White Papers as an ongoing series of original articles, essays and papers about disruptive innovation theory, research and application.

We write about how to apply the framework of disruption to non-traditional domains--seeking new approaches to intractable problems for the public good. We focus particularly on societal architecture and formidable cultural considerations and how they impede the progress and predicted diffusion of disruptive innovation. We attempt to crawl up inside and see what makes people tick. The Off-White Papers are written under the aegis of the Disruptor Foundation co-founded by Harvard Business School Professor Clayton Christensen, Craig Hatkoff and Rabbi Irwin Kula. Professor Christensen is the father of disruptive innovation theory first popularized in \"The Innovator’s Dilemma.\" Craig Hatkoff is co-founder of the Tribeca Film Festival and Chief Curator of the annual Tribeca Disruptive Innovation Awards. Hatkoff is currently Adjunct Professor at Columbia Business School where he created and teaches the course on Disruptive Innovation.
