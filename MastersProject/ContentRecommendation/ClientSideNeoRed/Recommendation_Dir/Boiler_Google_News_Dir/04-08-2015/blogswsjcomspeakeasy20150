Sixteen years after his last album,Dr. Dreis finally throwing his suffering fans a bone.
The rapper and record producer announced on his Beats 1 radio show this Saturday that his soundtrack to Straight Outta Compton, an upcoming biopic about seminal 1980s gangsta rap group N.W.A.which included Dr. Dre, Ice Cube and Eazy-Ewill be released Friday as an Apple exclusive.
Its going to be my grand finale, Dr. Dre said on his show.
The album, called Compton: A Soundtrack by Dr. Dre, has appearances by Ice Cube, Kendrick Lamar and Eminem, among others. The film, which takes its name from N.W.A.s classic 1988 album, comes out August 14 .
Dr. Dre, 50, released his last proper album, 2001, in 1999. A long-awaited follow-up, Detox, never materialized.
A co-founder of Beats Electronics LLC, Dr. Dre joined Apple Inc. last year (along with the firm)but he has squeezed out only a few songs in recent years.
