California launches "drought shaming" website

California has multiple restrictions on water use, including banning washing cars with hoses that don't shut off and restricting lawn-watering within two days of rainfall. But enforcement varies widely across the parched state.
Residents can send details and photos of water waste at www.savewater.ca.gov . Complaints are then sent to local government agencies based on the address of the offense.
Tipsters wary of being outed as the neighborhood snitch can remain anonymous.
The State Water Resources Control Board Water announced California cut its water use by 27 percent in June, passing the conservation target set by Gov. Jerry Brown.
Data shows 265 out of 411 local water agencies hit or nearly reached their reduction goals.
The site went online Thursday as the latest conservation initiative. More than 300 agencies have signed up to see the details of water waste tips. Many local agencies already had their own reporting sites.
"Our water use complaint calls have gone up exponentially from the last two years," Terrance Davis of the Sacramento Department of Utilities told CBS affiliate KOVR in July. The city said from January to June, it received more than 8,000 complaints.
"Obviously we can't see everything, can't be everywhere so having people in the community helping us out--residents, neighbors--reporting those types of things is a great tool for us too," Davis said.
