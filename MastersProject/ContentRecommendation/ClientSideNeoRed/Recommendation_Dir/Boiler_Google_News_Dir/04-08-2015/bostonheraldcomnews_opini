Bay State Congressman Seth Moulton today came out in favor of the controversial Iran nuclear deal and said while it isnt perfect its by far the best viable option before us.
After carefully reviewing the details of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, listening to my constituents including leaders in the Jewish community, and consulting with a wide variety of military and civilian experts, I have determined that the best course of action to prevent a nuclear Iran is by supporting and implementing the agreement, Moulton said, in a statement. It is not a perfect deal, and it is easy to point out the many ways in which it could theoretically be stronger.
Moulton said he believes the deal is enforceable and saves the United States from choosing between two alternatives  going to war with Iran or upping sanctions against the Middle East power.
Taking military action against Iran would only set Irans nuclear program back five years at most, reaffirm their pursuit of a nuclear weapon, and drive the program underground, he said, adding that other countries may not hold up their end of the bargain if further sanctions were levied.
The deal would theoretically curb Irans nuclear program in exchange for relief from hefty economic sanctions. President Obama has been working to get Democrats to sign off on the deal since it was announced on July 14.
