Dozens of topless women and men staged a Bare With Us rally in Canada meant to educate the public about women's right to go shirtless if they choose.
The rally and march were organised by three sisters who were stopped by a police officer for biking topless a week ago.
People in Waterloo, Ontario, were waving banners and wearing body paint with messages including "everyone has the right to NOT be harassed" and "Bare With Us! They're just boobs!"
Musician Alysha Brilla said she and her sisters were not wearing shirts while cycling in Kitchener, Ontario, on July 24 when a male police officer drove up beside them and told them to cover up because it was the law.
Brilla said told the officer he was wrong and that when she started filming the interaction on her mobile phone, the officer said he had only wanted to check if the women had proper bells and lights on their bicycles.
Ontario women have had the right to go topless in public since 1996.
A similar incident in June garnered headlines after an eight-year-old was told by city staff in Guelph, Ontario, to cover up while she was in a paddling pool wearing only a swim bottom.
