"I was leaving the set, coming to the studio and I felt myself just being so inspired by the movie that I started recording an album, he can be heard saying in the video clip below. And I kept it under wraps. And the album is finished.
Its gonna be my grande finale, Dre added.

Dre also explained why he never released the long-awaited planned album Detox: "It just wasn't good."
The reason Detox didn't come out was because I didn't like it, Dre said.  I don't think I did a good enough job, and I couldn't do that to my fans and I couldn't do that to myself, to be perfectly honest with you. I just wasn't feeling it."
