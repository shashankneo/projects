FANCY FARM, Ky.  In sweltering western Kentucky heat, candidates comprising the down-ticket statewide races exchanged verbal blows with each other while fending off an at times raucous crowd at the 135th Fancy Farm picnic.
The rough rhetoric underscored how important the other constitutional offices are to Democrats and Republicans as they seek to gain voters attention to kick-off the fall campaign season.
In the battle to be Kentuckys next attorney general, Democrat Andy Beshear, the son of outgoing Gov. Steve Beshear, poked fun at claims that he is running solely on his familys name.
Political observers have in part accounted for Beshears solid 7-point lead over Republican candidate Whitney Westerfield in the latest Bluegrass Poll to his fathers popularity.
When I was growing up I had a perfectly normal childhood, said Andy Beshear. Sure, instead of bedtime stories we had polling data, instead of cartoons we had Comment on Kentucky, but a totally normal childhood.
Beshear also dredged up allegations in Westerfields personnel file as an assistant Commonwealth's Attorney that claim the GOP nominees personal interests  including pedicure appointments  took precedent over his duties.
Republicans have called the Democratic attack ads petty and Westerfield, a state senator from Hopkinsville, Ky., has defended his work record as a prosecutor. Speaking to Beshear directly on the St. Jerome Parish stage, Westerfield flipped those attempts to criticize his work record on its ear.
I did have a pedicure at lunch, but Im ready to go toe-to-toe with you right now, said Westerfield.
Westerfield reminded onlookers that as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee he was a co-sponsor of a comprehensive bill tackling Kentuckys heroin problem and has led efforts on juvenile justice and defending social conservative issues such as anti-abortion and traditional marriage. He said that unlike Beshear, a lawyer with Stites & Harbison in Louisville, he has experience as a prosecutor.
We dont need ladder climbing politicians and we certainly dont need someone who is looking for on the job training, said Westerfield.
Another heavily watched matchup down the ballot is between Democratic incumbent Adam Edelen and Republican state Rep. Mike Harmon for the state auditor seat, which is seen as a proxy battle with U.S. Senator Rand Paul.
Harmon opened up with a number of wild jabs at Edelen and other state Democrats, but said little about what he would do if elected auditor. Edelen used his initial remarks to tout his offices review of law enforcement agencies to examine untested rape kits and to praise U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells leadership on the issue.
Edelen then pivoted to blasting Paul, who skipped this years Fancy Farm to be in Iowa for events around his presidential bid.
We also prefer the speeches that Rand Paul gives at Fancy Farm to the ones he gives in the well of the U.S. Senate , said Edelen, a rumored Senate candidate. The difference being at Fancy Farm, he is limited to five minutes and his speeches dont jeopardize the national security of this country.
Others, including Fancy Farm emcee and sports radio host Matt Jones, piled on Paul for failing to show up this year. Jones said Paul doesnt have time for Kentuckys annual political picnic because "he has a presidential race to lose.
Paul spokeswoman Kelsey Cooper bristled at Jones assertion, however.
To suggest that Senator Paul, someone with nearly perfect attendance in the Senate, is anything but completely committed to the job he was elected to do is a blatant disregard for his strong record of defending and supporting the values and issues important to all Kentuckians, she said.

Kentucky, I have just begun to fight, Grimes said.
Grimes spent much of her time attacking Republican candidate for governor Matt Bevin, rather than her own opponent, Steve Knipper. Donald Trump and Matt Bevin actually have a lot in common, including that neither one will ever win elected office, Grimes quipped.
For his part, Knipper, a business analyst and city councilman from Erlanger, criticized Grimes for being absent from her office during her first term because she was campaigning for the U.S. Senate seat.
But its totally not fair to say Miss Grimes hasnt done anything. Shes tried to make it easier for veterans to vote. For Mitch McConnell,  Knipper said.
The two candidates for agriculture commissioner each claimed to be the only one with an authentic background in farming. Democrat Jean Marie Lawson Spann mocked the advanced education of her opponent, Republican State Rep. Ryan Quarles, of Georgetown, Ky.
She called Quarles an Ivy Legue lawyer who boasts that he holds six college degreesTo lead Kentucky agriculture you must have done more than just spend your life going to school.
She closed by saying, My name is Jean Marie Lawson Spann. Im Kentucky born, Kentucky educated, and Kentucky proud.
But Quarles said he grew up bailing hay and shoveling manure. And he also had a catchy slogan:  My name is Ryan Quarles. Im field-ready, farm-tested, and ready to serve as your next commissioner of agriculture.
Quarles, like nearly every Republican candidate, invoked the presidents name during his remarks. There are two candidates in this race. One voted for Obama. One didnt, he said, arguing the Obama administration has over-regulated farms.
Republican candidate for treasurer Allison Ball, of Prestonsburg, Ky., stressed voters should be sure to distinguish her from Grimes. I am the good Allison on the ballot, Ball said. The other Alison is a little bit confused about who she voted for for president the last time around. So Im happy to tell you that I voted against Barack Obama.
As a bankruptcy attorney and former prosecutor, Ball argued she is better qualified for the job. She called her opponent, Democratic Rep. Rick Nelson, of Bell County, a member of the liberal Democrat House for 14 years.
But Nelson, the last of 21 speakers on the program, said he would not criticize Ball because he says hes never criticized a political opponent. Nelson told a thinning crowd that as someone who taught school for 29 years and served in the General Assembly, I believe that I have the life experience and the job experience to be your next Kentucky treasurer.
