Ridiculously good-looking trailer of "Zoolander 2" leaks online
A trailer for " Zoolander 2" has leaked online ahead of the sequel's 2016 release.
The unauthorized video begins with a voiceover from a Stephen Hawking soundalike and a journey through the cosmos before arriving in the brain of Derek Zoolander, which is full of hairdryers, orange mocha Frappucinos, incorrect math equations (3 + 4 = 34) and words like "eugoogly."
"If God exists, then why did he make ugly people?" Ben Stiller asks in the clip, pondering one of Zoolander's most troubling philosophical quandaries.
Stiller is back as the dim male model. Owen Wilson, Will Ferrell and Christine Taylor all reprise their roles from the 2001 original. Stiller directed from a script he wrote with Justin Theroux.
Stiller and Wilson partook in some gonzo publicity when they walked the Valentino runway at Paris Fashion Week as Zoolander and Hansel.
" Zoolander 2 " bows in theaters Feb. 12, 2016.
