Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said that Crimea is Europes problem, much more so than ours in an interview with CNN broadcast on Friday.
Trump, in response to a question about what he would do with Crimea, answered, this is Europes problem, much more so than ours, okay? And Europe isnt complaining as much as we are. But this is more of a Europe problem. And when Europe comes to us and says we want your help, we want your help. But, theyre not doing that. Theyre dealing with Russia, theyre taking in the gas, theyre taking in the oil. Theyre not doing that. Were making a big deal out of it, but why isnt Germany leading this one? You know, Germany is a very rich, very powerful nation. Why arent they dealing on it more so?
Trump added that the US is like the policeman of the world, and Europe should be fighting this, Europe should come to us, and say, Listen, we want your help on this. Were going to them. Why isnt Europe more involved? Why isnt Germany more bothered by this?
