The world is outraged at the recent killing of Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe, lured outside a national park and shot it with a bow and arrow.
The animal did not die until 40 hours later after being shot by American dentist Walter Palmer.
There are calls for Mr Palmer to be extradited to Zimbabwe to face justice as the world's largest animal rights group PETA calls for an end to trophy hunting.
Cecil's death has drawn attention to the lucrative business of African trophy hunting, with approximately 105,000 animals killed each year there, some of them endangered.
Spain's King Juan Carlos has killed an elephant, Prince William has hunted in Zimbabwe and cricketer Glenn McGrath faced an angry backlash when photos of him posing with a dead elephant were published in 2014.
Trophy hunting is big business; it is reported Mr Palmer paid US$50,000 for the opportunity to shoot Cecil.
But hunting is not just limited to Africa. All over the world, animals are being hunted, in many instances purely as trophies.
