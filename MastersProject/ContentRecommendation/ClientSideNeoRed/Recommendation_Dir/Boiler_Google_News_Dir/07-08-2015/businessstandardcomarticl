Rapper Andre Benjamin, also known as Andre 3000, has been signed on to star in season two of ABC's "American Crime".
The singer, best known for being part of hip hop duo Outkast, will be seen as architect Michael Lacroix, opposite returning star Regina King, who will play his wife Terri, reported Entertainment Weekly.
"A true power couple, they have both the financial means, as well as the acumen needed to fiercely defend their son when he becomes entangled in a scandal at an elite private school," ABC said.
The crime drama is created by John Ridley (writer of '12 Years a Slave'), with whom Andre worked in 2013's Jimi Hendrix film "Jimi: All Is By My Side".
"Personally, I couldn't be more excited than to work again with Andre. He is an amazing individual, a true artist, and 'All is by my Side' is one of the reasons I was given the reins on American Crime...
"It's fair to say 'American Crime' might not exist were it not for our previous collaboration," Ridley said.
Season one stars Felicity Huffman and Timothy Hutton will also return in the upcoming season.
