Saudi ambassador to London offers his condolences to the bin Laden family over the crash
Three passengers and the pilot died in the crash at Blackbushe Airport in southern England
LONDON (CNN)  Three members of Osama bin Laden 's family were among four people killed in a small plane crash in southern England, British police said.
The plane crashed Friday at a car auction site on the property of Blackbushe Airport in Hampshire, to the west of London, Hampshire fire and rescue services said.
Three passengers and the pilot died. Among those killed were three members of bin Laden's family, described as the mother, sister and brother-in-law of the plane's owner, Hampshire police said.
Police named neither the victims nor the plane's owner. The bin Laden family members were visiting the United Kingdom on vacation, police said.
The late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden  killed in a U.S. raid on a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in May 2011  was one of dozens of children of Mohammed bin Laden. The bin Laden family is large and is spread around the world.
The UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said Friday it had sent a team to investigate the incident but declined to give further details. The team remained at the site on Saturday.
No one on the ground was injured, police said.
The official Saudi Press Agency did not identify those on the plane but said it was a Saudi-registered Embraer 505 Phenom 300 aircraft.
Because the accident happened on British soil, the investigation will be in the hands of the AAIB.
The Saudi ambassador to Britain, Prince Mohammed bin Nawaf Al Saud, offered his condolences via Twitter to the family of the late Mohammed bin Laden over the crash Friday, but he did not name the victims.
