At Bobbi Kristina Browns private funeral at St. James United Methodist Church in Alpharetta this morning, the rift between families broke open outside when Bobby Browns sister Leolah made a public tirade against Pat Houston, Whitney Houstons sister in law.
TMZ has reported a long-standing feud between the Houston side of the family and the Brown side of the family.
During the funeral, Browns sister Leolah came out early to the media rabble and railed against Pat Houston, the sister in law of Whitney. She seemed angry, saying, Its not over. Its just begun. She wasnt specific about her beef with Pat but noted that Pat isnt even a blood relative to Bobbi Kristina. She has previously said she believes Pat is using Whitney and Bobbi Kristinas deaths for her own personal gain.
When asked about the funeral itself, Leolah said, It was wonderful until Pat started speaking and I didnt like that. I walked out. She said she yelled to Pat while she was at the dais, saying something along the lines of Whitney is going to haunt you from the grave.
She is being the phony person that she is, Leolah added.
TMZ said Tyler Perry helped remove her from the funeral. She returned back into the church but Im told she stayed in the lobby. ( TMZ also nabbed a copy of the program. )

Earlier, the hearse with Bobbi Kristinas body showed up at around 8:15 a.m. and a handful of media was there to capture it. At about 10:30 a.m., a procession, presumably with close family members, arrived, led by several motorcycle cops.
We had no access inside. Outside, there were about 60 media types, mostly photographers training their cameras on the parking lot and entrance of the church, hoping to catch family members and celebrities. Some of the media included Associated Press (the reporter dressed up in suit and tie like he was attending the funeral but was unable to get in), Splash News, Getty Images, Reuters, the Daily Mail, V-103 (Maria Boynton) and the local TV stations.
Curiosity seekers, including neighbors with dogs, were relatively modest, maybe 60 or so over a span of four hours.
From 9 a.m. to 2 p.m, Alpharetta police provided only partial access to Webb Bridge Road to most normal traffic. Part of the road was set aside for media. It was all very organized. The only extraneous noise for a time was a helicopter hovering overhead.

Maria Corkern, an elementary school teacher who lives across the street from the church, planted a chair and an umbrella to watch the proceedings. (She was also interviewed by a German television station.)
Im a huge R&B fan, Corkern said. And I have a 23-year-old daughter so my heart goes out to this family. Aside from the media circus, someone is burying their daughter today and I cant imagine that.
Reo Wallace, a hairstylist, drove in from Conyers early in the morning. She was one of the first people there and was able to see Bobbi Kristinas hearse pass by.
I got chills, Wallace said. From being detached from it on television, it became real.
She said she has a 23-year-old daughter herself. When she heard about Bobbis coma in January, I was devastated. It was similar to the way Whitney accidentally died. Its very eery and morbid.

Artelia Martin of Atlanta drove up to Alpharetta to pay her respects. I feel like shes at peace, Martin said. Shes with her mom. As a Delta customer service agent, she said she got to escort both Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown, along with Bobbi Kristina several times through the airport. They were very nice, she said.
Judy Daughtry and Janice Harris from Wilmington, N.C. came up Friday and stayed in a hotel before coming to the church at 9:30 a.m.. I wanted to support Whitney. Her music is from our era. We love Bobbi Kristina as well, Daughtry said. It feels good for the connection of being here.
The families held a wake Friday at Murray Brothers Funeral Home, which was reportedly attended by Whitney Houstons mother Cissy and Bobbi Kristinas father Brown.
The body will be flown up to New Jersey and a private burial is scheduled for Monday, where Bobbi Kristinas grave will sit next to her mothers.
Bobbi Kristina passed last month after being in a coma since she was found unconscious in a bathtub.

May this poem comfort all those that LOVE YOU,
Do not stand at my grave and weep,
I am Not There - I do not sleep.
I am the Thousand winds that blow,
I am the Diamond glints in snow,
I am the Sunlight on ripened grain,
I am the Gentle Autumn Rain.
As you awake with morning's hush
I am the swift-up-flinging rush
Of Quiet birds in circling flight.
Do not stand at my grave and cry,
I am Not There - I did Not die.
Bobby Brown and his family are trash and Whitney Houston married trash. Why does the news media, particularly the AJC, spend so much time and effort cover trash?
Who holds a press conference in the middle of the Road? Do you mind? Clown college.
Yet again we see a display of washing the dirty linen in public. These people have no integrity, no sense of decency and no comprehension of grieving properly. This circus is a prime example of why funerals of well-known individuals should be private and the media informed in no certain terms that they are not welcomed at any event related to the death of a public figure. How many Methodist churches have metal barricades in their store rooms?
The young woman died too young and that is very sad. However there is a great deal of suspicion surrounding her drug dealer boyfriend and his pal. Bobbi Kristina is not a celebrity. She never cut a record, never starred in a film, never had a job and only by the accident of birth totwo talenteddrug addicts did she have any claim to fame.The photo of the policeescort is completely over the top ghetto promotion by her family. Yes, the officers were off duty yet it is rare to see more than two (2) police escorts for a regular person and more, appropriately, for a veteran of the Armed Services.
This entire process since Bobbi Kristina was found in the tub to the hospital arguments, the fight in the hotel bar, the endless vigil at the hospice and the endless media reports on this tribe was completely designed to be The Greatest Show on Earth. On that level, it was somewhat successful but the entire audience was there to either strut their stuff or yell"Theater!" in a crowded fire.
"Disgraceful" doesn't even begin to cover the actions of a turbocharged dysfunctional family.
I was watching NatGeo one time and they showed two troops of monkeys fighting over possession of a fig tree. Deja vu here.
What a side show this whole thing has been.
It just goes to show that money won't buy class.
Also a little morbid to drive in from Conyers to sit in the 90% heat hoping to get a glimpse of something at a funeral.
Must not have much of a life to line ropes for a wake for someone most folks have never even heard of. STRANGE
                                  "Pants Up"  "Don't Loot"
Hopefully this infestation didn't turn Alpharetta into a ghetto too bad while they were there. Darkies crack me up. The one fat one is dressed in jeans and sneakers ....at a funeral. You can see her "attitude" on her face, quite common for blacks. They all think everybody owes them something, are always causing problems, always complaining. Note how 85% of all black female names end with the letter 'a' or an 'a' sound, as in "Oprah".
CRAP, I have been traveling and just got back in town, did I miss the shooting, stabbing and spitting ?
What someone else eats don't make you fat.  Do you get it?  Whether they be "black fat" or "white fat" how does it impact you dude? Hurting people hurt people. When people like you say the ignorant stupid things you do, you are a hurting guy. You've got to be a miserable being who hides behind the keyboard for a release. God help you.
You don't have to be famous and richto have disagreements when a love one dies.  Race does not matter. Emotions and grieving are part of the process and people handle it differently.
@ChicagoBJ But most of us 1) control our emotions in public and 2) grieve in private. This family doesn't do either.
What a trasht tramp that Leolah is. And who the heck wears sneakers to a funeral. She looks like something out of a freak show. What an old, bitter, evil, greedy, hateful person. The ties that bind are broken now. She should take her ally A home, and shut up. What a poor example of a female. They say, "Hell has no fury like a woman scorned". But, this B is straight out of hell and then some.
Pretty disgraceful for an adult to be so self centered -- but, what can one say. Tyler Perry should be applauded for acting as a peacemaker and gentleman. Sad that others are too self absorbed to act as an adult. (And we wonder why so many of our kids act the fool much of the time!)
@RickStaples. What is the purpose of your post? I'm asking, seriously.
So this is someone's job to write about a funeral?
How sad is this?
Leolah Brown causes chaos at Bobbi Kristinas funeral 
As predicted, Leolah Brown caused a major scene at Bobbi Kristinas funeral. Security had to remove her from the church. Details below on how it all went down. #LeolahBrown #BobbiKristinaFuneral
WARNING: HEAVY BLACK INFESTATION IN ALPHARETTA! Can you imagine the EBONICS there? "Hey girlfreeeent! Yo' big FAT REAR END be blockin' mah view o' Bobbi Christina. Her be DEAH. I wants to see she once last time, is".
@prarrd Parrad: What someone else eats don't make you fat.  Do you get it?  Whether they be "black fat" or "white fat" how does it impact you dude? Hurting people hurt people.  When people like you say the ignorant stupid things you do, you are a hurting guy. You've got to be a miserable being who hides behind the keyboard for a release. God help you.
This is all normal behavior for blacks. Having an "attitude" is what they do. Note how fat most black people are too! Blacks are #1 in obesity, food stamps, crime, and child abuse.
@prarrd How would you know? And, I can recall a lot of arguments at white funerals, so stop pretenting to be high and mighty. Whites have done it since the beginning of time and throughout history...the accurate version, that is.
@prarrd You are number 1 in heroin and meth overdoses, mass killings, embezzlement and white collar crimes, incest.  If you are smart enough to know when the white drug pusher sells heroin and meth to the white kid who dies. It's call murder (white on white killings). You have selective memory. It was a white man who just shot and killed at the movie theater in Louisiana. Did younot rememberall of the other recent mass killings?
@PatrickThomas  @prarrd So funny to see how blacks try to hide all their problems and blame them on everyone else. Face it. 90% of you are LOSERS!! A good 40% of you are criminals. Another 20% of you are welfare cheats. You try to name a few mass killings by whites. They happen what, twice per year? Meanwhile, blacks kill 38 people per day, EVERY DAY on average in the USA.
Its amazing white people want to call black people ignorant meanwhile they are the main ones that are ignorant...your post was so uncalled for and you should really ask god for forgiveness for all the hateful things you do.
@Sheila Hebert Baker Racists always do this, everywhere. Their hate is so overwhelming they cannot help themselves.
Rest in peace. Like her mother, she passed away much too young. Shame on all of you who posted racist comments as this family mourns their loss.
I, for one am surprised the Brown family didn't sell tickets to this train wreck......there are more than enoughNational Enquirer and Star subscribersthat could care less about their own lives, and obsess over the lives of "celebrities" that would have paid for entrance this latest media circus.
There is white,uneducated trash and this is black,uneducated trash. Folks,it is bred in deeply and NOTHING can help. Different folks for sure. No one can overcome stupid!
Will that Larda$$ Governor of New Jersey fly state flags at half-staff like he did for the crack-addict Whitney? Can you say "Pandering to the Blacks of New Jersey"?
You saw it here first: a funeral with a bouncer.
You dont care yet you took out the time to read and comment on the story.....okay! #sad
@Re Al A T No, the world will be a better place without you and your racist relatives, who walk the face of the earth taking up valuable oxygen. You have bred hate from the time you were born, and you what forever do so because racist animals like you belong in hell. Of course, you will meet your brother Lucifer, in due time. After all, everyone knows he slept with your mother, and encouraged you down that pedophile path you have been on for the past decade.
@Re Al A T  I don't care ifBobby Brown had3 legs and Whitney had5 they loved their child.  A dog loves theirpuppies. You must not feelthat you are loved to makesuch a statement.Hurting people hurt people. Get some help before we hearyou inthenews shooting at people in themovie theatre.
These people are so depressing. They cannot behave themselves anywhere.
Funny how AJC buried a story of a shooting on MARTA last week but can't stop reporting on this nonsense.
@butchcat  This is much more sensational than a plain old MARTA shooting.
Sorry but this is not California , it is Georgia. The average Georgian doesn't worship the family members of celebrities any more than the celebrities themselves. If you are going to do a story on this death you need to spend equal time on every death that made the obituaries. Her death , though sad , is only important to her loved ones who are no more important than any other family who lost a love one.
@7576DAWG I am not a relative, but it is important to me.
