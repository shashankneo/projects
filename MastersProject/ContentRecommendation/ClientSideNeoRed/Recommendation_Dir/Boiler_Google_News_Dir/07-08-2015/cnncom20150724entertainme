February 2009: Brown's legal troubles began when Los Angeles police responded to a 911 call that a woman was assaulted on a Hollywood street just after midnight on February 8. They found his girlfriend, Rihanna, then 20, with a badly bruised face. Brown, then 19, turned himself into police hours before he and Rihanna were to perform at the Grammys.

March 2009: Brown apologized a week after his arrest. "Words cannot begin to express how sorry and saddened I am over what transpired," he said. "I am seeking the counseling of my pastor, my mother and other loved ones and I am committed, with God's help, to emerging a better person." He was formally charged with felony counts of assault and making criminal threats that March 5.

August 2009: On the day Brown was sentenced in the assault, a probation report revealed he and Rihanna were involved in at least two other incidents of domestic violence before the February 2009 attack. One in Europe in fall 2008 involved Rihanna slapping Brown during an argument, and Brown responded by shoving her into a wall, the report said.

September 2009: Brown and his mother appeared on CNN's "Larry King Live" in his first TV interview since his arrest. "I've said countless times how sorry I am to Rihanna, and I just accepted full responsibility," Brown said. "But it's just one of those things I wish I could have relived and just handled totally different."

February 2010: Brown earned a glowing probation report six months after he was sentenced to "labor-oriented service" for assaulting Rihanna. "It looks like you're doing really, really well," Judge Patricia Schnegg told Brown during a February 18 probation hearing.  The police chief in Richmond, Virginia -- where Brown was allowed to complete his sentence -- reported the singer had worked 32 days of hard labor. Here Brown performs on NBC's "Today" show in July 2011.

Summer 2010: That June, Brown broke down in tears during his performance of "Man in the Mirror" at the BET Awards in Los Angeles. In August, he received another good probation report. "You're doing very well on probation," the judge told him on August 26. His next probation report in November 2010 was also positive. After another positive review in February 2011, the judge removed the "stay away" order that barred Brown from contact with Rihanna.

March 2011: Brown stormed off the set of ABC's "Good Morning America" on March 22 after Robin Roberts mentioned the assault on Rihanna.

Brown apologized the next day, saying he was "disappointed in the way I acted."

February 2012: A woman filed a police complaint against Brown , accusing him of grabbing her iPhone after she used it to take a photo of the singer in a car on a Miami street on February 19.

June 2012: A fight allegedly between Drake and Brown and their entourages broke out at a New York nightclub on June 14. Brown said he was a victim. The melee left Brown with a nasty gash on his chin and fueled rumors that it started because of an argument about Rihanna, whom both men have dated. Here Drake, left, and Brown hang out in New York in August 2010.

September 2012: Brown's streak of glowing probation reports came to an end on September 5 when the judge lectured him for testing positive for marijuana use in Virginia. The drug test failure did not result in a probation violation, although pot is illegal in Virginia. Brown told authorities he ingested the marijuana in California, where he has a medical marijuana card, according to the judge. Rihanna tweeted to Brown: "I'm praying for you and wishing u the best today!" Brown responded, "Thank u so much." Here Brown appears in court in September 2013.

August 2013: A deal to reinstate Brown's probation was reached, but it meant the singer had to complete an additional 1,000 hours of community labor in Los Angeles. The agreement allowed Brown to avoid a trial on the question of whether he had falsified his community labor reports in Virginia. Here, Brown's attorney, Mark Geragos, talks to reporters after a judge dropped a hit-and-run charge against Brown that same month. The singer reached a "civil compromise" with his accuser.

October 2013: Chris Brown reached into Lindsay Lohan's playbook for avoiding jail: Go to rehab before your court date.

November 2013: A judge ordered Brown to enter another rehab program and stay for 90 days . A probation report revealed at a November 20 hearing that Brown was booted from a rehab facility for smashing his mother's car window during a family session.

February 2014: A judge rejected the prosecutor's motion to pull Brown from rehab and send him to jail on February 3. Brown was becoming more violent, with his outbursts "increasing in severity and intensity," a deputy district attorney argued. Judge James Brandlin ruled Brown was again in violation of probation, but he cited a new probation report saying the singer was "doing well in the program and making great strides" in rehab.

February 2014: Brown successfully completed a 90-day, court-ordered rehab program in November, but the judge decided on February 28 that the singer should remain a resident in the facility until after his assault trial in April.

He closed his eyes and appeared to meditate, while his attorney met privately with the judge and prosecutor.

"Manila, it was fun. I love y'all man," Chris Brown says in a video posted to Twitter.
A contract dispute had prevented the singer from leaving the Philippines
(CNN)
Singer Chris Brown left the Philippines on Friday after a contract dispute initially prevented him from departing the country.
The 26-year-old singer headed out for Hong Kong at 9:30 p.m. local time, Eric Apolinario, a spokesman for the  Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines, told CNN.
A video posted to Brown's Twitter account seemed to corroborate the departure.
"Manila, it was fun. I love y'all man," the singer said in the video.
The Philippine Department of Justice said it issued an order earlier this week to prevent Brown from leaving the country over a contract dispute.
Before leaving the Philippines, Brown protested that he had nothing to do with the contract dispute.
"This is a very serious situation and someone needs to be held accountable for mixing my name up in all this," the award-winning musician tweeted Friday. "I've done nothing wrong!!!"
The contract dispute in question involved a New Year's Eve concert he failed to perform.
"I have nothing to do with anything going on right now," Brown tweeted. "I came back to Manila to do a make up show for New Years."
Both the tweets he posted were deleted prior to his exit from the country.
Brown is scheduled to appear Friday night in Macau. Tickets are almost $600.
