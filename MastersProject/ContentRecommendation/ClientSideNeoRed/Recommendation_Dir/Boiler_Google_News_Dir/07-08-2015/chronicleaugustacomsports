BLAINE, Minn.  Thoughts of 59 crept into Kenny Perrys mind early in his record-tying round Saturday in the Champions Tours 3M Championship.

Tom Lehman followed his opening 64 with 71 to drop into a tie for fourth at 9-under with Bernhard Langer and Marco Dawson. Langer and Dawson each shot 67.

 In Aberdeen, Scotland, Marc Warren holed an approach shot from 59 yards for eagle on the 19th hole to beat Tyrrell Hatton in a quarterfinal match at the Paul Lawrie Match Play.
