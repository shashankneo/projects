WILMINGTON, Del. (AP)  Verizon workers in Delaware are planning rallies as their labor contract with the telecommunications giant is set to expire.
Rallies are planned for 11 p.m. Saturday in Wilmington, Dover and Rehoboth Beach. The workers contract expires at midnight.
The Communications Workers of America announced last week that 86 percent of Verizon workers covered by the contract voted to strike in a recent poll.
The contract covers 39,000 Verizon workers in nine states from Massachusetts to Virginia who work for Verizons wireline business. About 600 of them are in Delaware.
The union says Verizon wants to roll back pensions and force employees to contribute significantly more to their health care coverage. Verizon has said the proposal is solid and creates opportunities for success in a changing telecom industry.
