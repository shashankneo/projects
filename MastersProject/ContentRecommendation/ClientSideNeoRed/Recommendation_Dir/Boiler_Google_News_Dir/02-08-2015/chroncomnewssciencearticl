Warm blob of ocean water, drought warming Puget Sound waters

County, state and federal scientists say they're concerned about the consequences for Puget Sound marine life.
The warm conditions are leading to more toxic algae blooms, shellfish closures and lower dissolved oxygen levels that make it harder for fish to survive.
The scientists said Thursday the mass of warm water from the Pacific Ocean, dubbed "the Blob," has moved into Puget Sound. It's increasing water temperatures by four degrees higher than normal for this time year in some locations.
Also, a low mountain snowpack means not enough melting snow flowing in rivers. Because of that, there hasn't been enough circulation to push the warm blob out of Puget Sound.
