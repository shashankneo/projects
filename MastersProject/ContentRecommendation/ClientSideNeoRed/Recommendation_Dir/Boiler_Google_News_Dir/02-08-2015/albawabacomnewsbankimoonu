UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed concern Monday about the recently heightened tensions between Turkey and the PKK group.
"[Ban]calls on all concerned to refrain from returning to a deadly conflict which has in the past brought so much suffering and grief to the people of Turkey", according to a statement from his spokesperson's office.
Tensions have risen between Turkeyand theKurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in the past week, with the latter stepping up attacks on police and troops while Turkish warplanes target the groups camps and police round up suspected supporters.
The separatist groupis listed by Turkey, the US and EU as a terrorist organization.
"[Ban] expresses the hope that there will be an immediate return to constructive dialogue in order to continue to find a peaceful solution to the challenge at hand", the UN statement said.
The Turkish operations came after a major escalation in tensions in Turkey's southern border region, including a July 20 suicide bomb attack allegedly carried out by Daesh thatkilled 32 victims.
