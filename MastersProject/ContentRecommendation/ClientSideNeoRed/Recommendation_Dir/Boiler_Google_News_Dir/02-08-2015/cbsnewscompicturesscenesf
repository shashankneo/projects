Grant Park
Bob O'Neill, president of the Grant Park Conservancy, told CBS Station WBBM that Lollapalooza is a model for what other music festivals should be.
"It's the biggest music festival in a downtown park, it's wildly successful, and it's very important to Chicago's economy," he said. "Last year, it brought in $140 million to the economy."
It's also become a fundraiser for green space; last year's festival brought in $3.8 million for Chicago parks, said O'Neill.
