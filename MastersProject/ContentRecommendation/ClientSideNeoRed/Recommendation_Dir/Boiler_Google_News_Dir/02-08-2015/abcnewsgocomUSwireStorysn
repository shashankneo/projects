A teenager who spent nearly 40 days in custody before a judge cleared him of throwing a dangerous snowball is suing the Detroit school district, saying his rights were violated by a malicious prosecution.
Dominique Rondeau, now 18, was accused of throwing an icy snowball that shattered the windshield of a school police car in December 2013. He denied it. Unable to come up with $2,000 bond, he spent weeks in juvenile detention until his bond was reduced.
A judge dismissed the case after officers looked at a video in court and couldn't identify Rondeau as the person who threw the snowball, the Detroit Free Press reported Saturday ( http://on.freep.com/1LWvkI4 ).
"The only evidence they had was the camera, and the camera couldn't see anything," said Rondeau, who was 16 at the time.
Maria Miller, a spokeswoman for prosecutors, said her office relied on the officers' assertions that they could identify Rondeau, who is considered emotionally impaired and has had other run-ins with authorities.
