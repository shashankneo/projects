A while back, I wrote How To Be A Man with considerable help from my pal, the WSJ's John Carney . It was a fresh and thoughtful look at what it means to be a man today.
Unfortunately, all I have to do is look around me to see that its time for a refresher.
And because good advice never goes out of style, here are 99 rules for men to live by:
1. Measure yourself only against your previous self.
2. Never cancel dinner plans with a woman by text message.
3. Ignore the boos. They usually come from the cheap seats.
4. You dont have to keep every secret, just the important ones.
5. If youre staying more than one night, unpack.
6. A suntan is not bought, its earned.
7. Place-dropping is worse than-name dropping.
