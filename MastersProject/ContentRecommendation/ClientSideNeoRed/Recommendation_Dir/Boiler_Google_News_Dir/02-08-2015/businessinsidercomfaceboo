Instead of wriggling your way through a crowd of people to achieve theperfect view of First Aid Kit at Chicago music festival Lollapalooza, you're spending your Saturdaysprawled on your couch at home.
That doesn't need to stop you from getting in on the action, though.
Thanks to Facebook's widespread roll out of remotely-accessible " Place Tips ,"you can still seephotos, posts, and the line-up from themusic festival even if you or your friends aren't there.
"This is the first time Place Tips will be implemented for an event and until now, Place Tips have only been available when youre at a particular place," a company spokesperson said in an email."During Lollapalooza, fans around the U.S. will be able to browse Lollapalooza Place Tips to see posts and photos from their friends who are there and live, trending content from the festival."
You should see a "Place Tips" info box when you fire up your Facebook app. Press it to start scrolling through Lolla-related content:

More striking than the umpteenth screaming-fans photo is the fact that Facebook is throwing itself into the same live-events space that Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram are tackling too.
By making Place Tips remotely accessible for Lollapalooza, Facebook hints at greater live-events ambitions for the future.
