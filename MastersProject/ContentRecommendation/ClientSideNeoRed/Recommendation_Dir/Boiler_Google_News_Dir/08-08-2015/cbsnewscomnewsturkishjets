Reports: Turkish jets hit ISIS in Syria, Kurds in Iraq
On Wednesday, the PKK claimed responsibility for the killing of two Turkish policemen near the Kurdish majority city of Sanliurfa, near the Syrian border.
In other attacks, seven police officers were injured after suspected PKK militants hurled a small bomb at a police station in Bismil town, near the mainly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir, the Dogan news agency reported Friday. Assailants also hurled a small bomb at officers inside a police vehicle in the town of Semdinli, near the border with Iraq, the agency said.
Turkey started attacking ISIS positions after the suicide bombing and an ISIS ambush that killed a Turkish soldier.
On Friday, three F-16 jets struck IS targets that included two command centers and a gathering point near the Turkish border in Syria. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said nine ISIS militants were killed in the raids.
Earlier Friday, thousands of police rounded up suspected ISIS operatives - as well as members of other militant groups in dawn raids, reports CBS News correspondent Holly Williams. Nearly 300 were arrested.
Yet Turkey's critics say that, until now, Turkey had failed to stop the flow of fighters crossing through its territory to Syria - where many joined ISIS.
