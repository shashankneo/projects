Rafael Nadal beats Andreas Seppi to reach Hamburg Open final
Rafael Nadal is into the final of the Hamburg Open following a comfortable 6-1 6-2 win over Italian Andreas Seppi.
The world number 10, who is chasing a record 47th clay title, broke his opponent seven times to seal victory in an hour and 18 minutes.
The Spaniard will now face another Italian, Fabio Fognini, in the final.
Fognini and his partner Simone Bolelli withdrew from their men's doubles semi-final on Saturday, gifting a final spot to Jamie Murray and John Peers.
In the final, Brit Murray and his Australian partner, who were beaten in the doubles final at Wimbledon last month, will face Colombian duo Juan Sebastian Cabal and Robert Farah.
