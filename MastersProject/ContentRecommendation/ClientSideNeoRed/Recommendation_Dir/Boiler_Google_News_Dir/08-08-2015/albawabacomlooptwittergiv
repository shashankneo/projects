Earlier this week, a Palestinian infant was burned to death when Israeli settlers staged a midnight attack on the West Bank village of Duma.
And while Palestinian officials and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's condemnations have failed to resonate,social media is responding to the brutal violence, too.
On Saturday, the Arabic hashtag#_ was trending on Twitter. In English, this means "burned baby."
Needless to say  the phrase comes with a lot of weight.
Twitter accounts worldwide poured out messages of grief, anger and disbelief over last week's events. Here are some of them.
