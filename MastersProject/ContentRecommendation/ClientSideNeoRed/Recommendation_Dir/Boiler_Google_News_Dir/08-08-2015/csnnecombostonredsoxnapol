BOSTON -- In terms of artistic merit, it left a lot to be desired. But therewas some late-inning drama, and for the Red Sox, a win, too, which havebeen rare enough.
Mike Napoli, whose name was mentioned prominently in trade rumorsbefore Friday's deadline, delivered a two-run homer into the first rowof the Monster Seats, erasing a one-run deficit and sending the RedSox to a 7-5 win over the Tampa Bay Rays.
The two teams combined for five errors and three wild pitches anda handful of lead changes.
Alejanrdo De Aza singled home a run in the fifth to snap a 3-3tie for the Sox, but Robbie Ross Jr. walked one batter and hit anotherin the seventh, and pinch-hitter John Jaso blasted a double over the headof center fielder Jackie Bradley Jr., giving the Rays a 6-5 lead.
In the bottom of the inning, however, David Ortiz worked an 11-pitchwalk against lefty Jake McGee and Napoli followed with his third homerin the last 13 games and 13th of the season.
Junichi Tazawa picked up the win, and Koji Uehara nailed down thesave, his 23rd of the season.
Starter Eduardo Rodriguez had an off night, walking four in justfive innings and allowing a run in each of the first three innings ofthe night.
