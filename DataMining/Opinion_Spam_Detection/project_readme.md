Opinion_Spam_Detection
======================

In this project, we used a novel approach to detect opinion Spam by modelling the data as a Dynamic Graph. Previous approaches to the problem of opinion Spam Detection have made use of a Static Graph. Our novel approach lets us get interesting Role Transition Patterns. We are also able to predict the possibility of future Spam using Personalized PageRank.

For handling the data, we used MongoDB.
